github workflow that calls make, and then does a release? Via a tag?


Various debian/ package directories to help my packages that I locally use.

* [mmark](github.com/mmarkdown/mmark) moved to nfpm to package a debian package. Just use 'make
  debian'
* [yamlfmt](github.com/miekg/yamlfmt) moved to nfpm to package a debian package. Just use 'make
  debian'
